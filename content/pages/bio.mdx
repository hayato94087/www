# Tim Feeley’s Bio

I'm an East Coast native who made the leap to the Bay Area in 2016, and I’ve been loving it ever since.

Over the past 20 years, I've had the privilege of working with incredible teams to bring our best ideas to life and make a real impact. Here's a glimpse of my journey:

When I'm not working, you can find me:

- Chilling with my two hairless cats, Boolean and Felix
- Catching a Broadway show
- Sharpening my React and web development skills

I’m constantly inspired by the fast-paced, ever-changing world of tech. I believe in using technology to solve real-world problems and create products that people _love_ to use.

I’m always on the lookout for opportunities to learn, grow, and make a difference. After all, we may not have it all figured out, but together, we can make _better mistakes tomorrow_.
