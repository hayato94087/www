# Tim Feeley’s Bio

Over the past 20 years, I've had the privilege of working alongside incredible
teams, turning ambitious aspirations into tangible results, at companies like:

<Timeline />

After graduating from the University of Rhode Island with a B.S. in Computer
Science and a minor in Communication Studies, I began my career in the
Boston-area startup scene as an engineer, Product Manager, UX specialist, and PM
leader, eventually becoming the Director of Core Site Experience at TripAdvisor
for a few years.

I made the leap to the Bay Area in 2016 and have been loving it ever since. I
moved here for an opportunity to PM Facebook’s Design System, where the fruits
of our labor culminated in a
[nice visual refresh](https://medium.com/designatmeta/evolving-the-facebook-news-feed-to-serve-you-better-f844a5cb903d)
for the app.

After that, I switched gears and lead the efforts of the Sign-in team at Google,
looking after the experiences people use to create, access and manage their
Google Accounts (as well as the underlying APIs that internal and external teams
build with.)

After a quick stint in Fintech at Goldman Sachs, I returned to Google to build
out data protection infrastructure to keep customers’ personal data safe and
secure as it moves across Google’s systems.

When I'm not working, you can find me:

- Chilling with my two hairless cats,
  [Boolean](https://instagram.com/booleanthebambino) and
  [Felix](https://instagram.com/hairlessfelix)
- Induilging a Broadway show (one of my favorites was
  [Something Rotten!](https://www.mtishows.com/something-rotten/))
- “Entertaining” my friends and trying
  [Hot Ones-inspired sauces](https://www.saucemania.com.au/hot-sauce/a-complete-list-of-hot-ones-hot-sauces/),
  despite their duly-noted protests.
- Trying to stay active on my Peloton, especially with Denis Morton's
  [Power Zone rides](https://www.onepeloton.com/instructors/denis-morton).

I’m constantly inspired by the fast-paced, ever-changing world of tech. I
believe in using technology to solve real-world problems and create products
that people _love_ to use.

I’m always on the lookout for opportunities to learn, grow, and make a
difference. After all, we may not have it all figured out, but together, we can
make _better mistakes tomorrow_.
