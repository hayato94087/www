# Hi friend, I’m Tim Feeley!

## I believe in technology

And its potential to amplify what humans are capable of accomplishing. It makes
the world a little smaller—and our place in it a little larger.

## I believe in people

Each app and every device we use is created by people, for people. Not merely
users, but humans of all backgrounds, abilities and dreams.

## I believe in you

Nobody’s perfect. But together, we can make better mistakes tomorrow.
